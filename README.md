# Azure AI Agent QuickStarts Demo

This is based on the [Azure AI Agent QuickStart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart), which demonstrates how to use the Azure AI Agent service to create a simple agent that can answer questions about a specific topic.

## Running the Demo

There is a JavaScript and TypeScript version of the demo in the `./src` directory. After going through the QuickStart steps, you can run either version. First install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the JavaScript version:

```

To run the TypeScript version:
